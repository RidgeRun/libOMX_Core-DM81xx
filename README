libOMX library for DM81xx SoC

The EZSDK provides OMX components in non Linux-friendly format for autotools
or others, so this library takes the components from the EZSDK and creates
and easy to use library with Linux standards (we even provide a pkgconfig file).

To build all you need to do is to pass the argument --with-ezsdkdir to the configure
or setup the environment variable EZSDKDIR when calling configure

This library always target the latest EZSDK, for older EZSDK releases see the
corresponding branch.
